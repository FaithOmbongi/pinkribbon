# [Where in Kenya could you get free screening for Breast Cancer?](#breast-cancer-screening)

This is an independently curated list of clinics where women can receive FREE screening for Breast Cancer during the [Breast Cancer Awareness Month of October][1].

<br>

**STATISTICS**

1. 50% of breast cancer cases in Kenya are diagnosed in late stages [^1].
2. Seven women die _every day_ in Kenya as a result of Breast Cancer [^2].

<br>

Ladies, we can reduce these statistics when we _know our breasts_ and detect abnormal signs _early_. That said, it is important to note that ***not all abnormal signs point to breast cancer***.

---

*Why do doctors emphasize early detection?* **Because breast cancer in it's early stages is more likely to be treated.**

*How can we detect breast cancer early?* **Through self breast examination and clinical screening.**

---

This resource shares a list of clinics, hospitals, and other businesses that offer or sponsor FREE clinical screening for breast cancer. In addition, we've included other screening services that are offered at discounted rates during this #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth.

We hope you find this resource useful for yourself and the women in your life. Fighting breast cancer takes everyone.
